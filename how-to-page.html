	             (What they will do when no compromise can be reached). Once player 1 is done providing their input, the continue button should be clicked. </li>
	        <li> Next, player 2 is given a minute to type their bargaining chips and walk-away options. Once player 2 is done providing their input, the continue button should be clicked. </li>
